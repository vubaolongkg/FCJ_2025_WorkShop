#### Create Admin User

You can use the AWS Management Console to create IAM users.

1. Follow the sign-in procedure appropriate to your user type as described in the topic [How to sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/Welcome.html) in the AWS Sign-In User Guide.

2. On the Console Home page, select the **IAM** service.

3. In the navigation pane, select **Users**, and then select **Add users**.

4. On the **Specify user details** page, under **User details**, enter the new user's name in the **User name** field. This will be their sign-in name for AWS.

   > **Note:** User names can be up to 64 letters, digits, and certain characters: plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at sign (@), underscore (_), and hyphen (-). User names must be unique within an account, and they are case-sensitive when used in policies or ARNs. However, they are case-insensitive during the sign-in process.

5. Select **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**. This generates AWS Management Console sign-in credentials for the new user.

6. You'll be asked whether you're providing console access to a person. It's recommended to create users in **IAM Identity Center** rather than IAM. To switch to creating the user in IAM Identity Center, select **Specify a user in Identity Center**.

   - If IAM Identity Center is not enabled, this option takes you to the service page in the console to enable it.
   - If IAM Identity Center is enabled, this option takes you to the **Specify user details** page in IAM Identity Center.

   If you cannot use IAM Identity Center, select **I want to create an IAM user** and continue following this procedure.

7. For **Console password**, choose one of the following:

   - **Autogenerated password**: The user gets a randomly generated password that adheres to the account password policy. You can view or download the password on the **Retrieve password** page.
   - **Custom password**: Assign a password that you enter in the box.

   Optionally, select **Users must create a new password at next sign-in (recommended)** to ensure the user changes their password the first time they sign in.

8. Select **Next**.

9. On the **Set permissions** page, choose how to assign permissions for this user:

   - **Add user to group**: Assign the user to one or more groups with existing permissions policies.
   - **Copy permissions**: Copy permissions from an existing user with similar needs.
   - **Attach policies directly**: Attach AWS managed or custom policies directly to the user.

   It's recommended to attach policies to groups whenever possible.

10. Optionally, set a **permissions boundary** in the **Permissions boundary** section. This is an advanced feature that controls maximum permissions.

11. Select **Next**.

12. Optionally, on the **Review and create** page, under **Tags**, you can attach metadata to the user using key-value pairs.

13. Review your choices, and when ready, select **Create user**.

14. On the **Retrieve password** page, get the password assigned to the user:

   - Select **Show** next to the password to view it manually.
   - Select **Download .csv** to save the user's sign-in credentials as a .csv file.
   - Select **Email sign-in instructions** to customize and send an email to the user. The email includes their user name and a URL to the account sign-in page:

     ```
     User name
     URL: https://AWS-account-ID-or-alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
     ```

     Note: The user's password is not included in the email.

If the user also requires access keys, refer to [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).


#### Login to AdminUser

1. Return to the IAM service, and select **Users** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the name of the IAM User you just selected.
3. In the **Summary** section, select the **Security credentials** tab. Look at the line **Summary: Console sign-in link** and copy the link next to it. This is the link you use to log in to the IAM User.

## Creating Access Key for AWS Root User

### Minimum Required Permissions

To perform the following steps, you need at least the following IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions:

- You must log in as the root user of AWS, which does not require any additional IAM permissions. These steps cannot be performed as an IAM user or a role.

- Use the email address and password of your AWS account to sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.

- In the top-right corner of the console, select your account name or number, then choose "Security Credentials".

- Under "Access keys," select "Create access key." If this option is unavailable, it means you have the maximum number of access keys. You must delete one of the existing access keys before creating a new one. For more information, see IAM Object Quotas in the IAM User Guide.

- On the "Alternatives to root user access keys" page, consider security recommendations. To proceed, check the box and then select "Create access key."

- On the "Retrieve access key" page, your Access Key ID will be displayed.

- Under the "Secret access key" section, select "Show," then copy the Access Key ID and Secret Key from your browser window and paste them into a secure location. Alternatively, you can select "Download .csv file" to download a file named "rootkey.csv" containing the Access Key ID and Secret Key. Keep the file in a secure location.

- Select "Done." When you no longer need the access key, we recommend either deleting it or at least considering disabling it to prevent misuse.

> Note: These steps apply only to the root user account on AWS. For IAM users or roles, the process of creating and managing access keys may differ.

## Revoking Access Key for Root User on AWS

### Minimum Permissions
To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions:

- You must be logged in as the root user of your AWS account, this does not require any additional AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. You cannot perform these steps as an IAM user or a role.
- Use the email address and password of your AWS account to sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.
- In the top-right corner of the console, select your account name or number, then choose **Security Credentials**.
- Under **Access keys**, select the access key you wish to delete, then in the **Actions** section, choose **Delete**.

> **Note**
> Alternatively, you can choose to **Deactivate** an access key instead of permanently deleting it. This allows you to continue using it in the future without changing both the key ID and secret key. While the key is deactivated, any requests using it in AWS API requests will fail with an "access denied" error.
>
> In the **Delete <access key ID>** dialog, select **Deactivate**, enter the access key ID to confirm your intention to delete it, then choose **Delete**.
