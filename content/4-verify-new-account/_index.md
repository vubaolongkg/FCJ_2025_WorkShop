During the AWS account creation process, at the contact phone number verification step, sometimes there will be a situation where no SMS or calls from AWS will be received. In that case, follow these steps to complete the account information verification:

#### Check the information

First, double-check your account information and make sure it's entered correctly:
- You have entered the phone number information and selected the correct international area code to receive the call.
- If you use a mobile phone, check your phone to make sure you are still within range to receive calls.
- Payment method information has been entered correctly.

Make sure that the phone number you provide in your AWS account is reachable.
