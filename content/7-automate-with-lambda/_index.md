## Automate with AWS Lambda

To fully automate the pipeline, we will use **AWS Lambda** to trigger the ETL process whenever a new file is uploaded.

### Steps:

- [7.1 Create Lambda Function](./7.1-create-lambda-function)
- [7.2 Write Python Code for Lambda](./7.2-write-python-code)
- [7.3 Attach S3 Trigger](./7.3-attach-s3-trigger)
