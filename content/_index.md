# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the FCJ 2025 AWS Workshop

#### Overview

In this hands-on workshop, you will build a **serverless data pipeline** using AWS services, from ingesting raw CSV files to visualizing clean data through QuickSight. You will also automate the process using Lambda and secure your solution with IAM & CloudTrail.

#### Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3** â€“ Store raw and processed files
- **AWS Glue Crawler** â€“ Catalog CSV structure
- **AWS Glue Job** â€“ Clean and transform data
- **Amazon Athena** â€“ Query processed data
- **Amazon QuickSight** â€“ Visualize insights
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Automate data flow
- **AWS CloudTrail** â€“ Track actions & monitor
